## Advent of Code in Haskell
This repository has my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in Haskell, I'm getting started learning Haskell so do expect lots of spagetti.. but hopefully it get better!


I usually last till day 13-15, so this will probably go around the same... but it's haskell and each problem takes around 5x the time if I would use a language I'm good at, so.. maybe day 8 would be a success!

## How to run
This is a [cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) project, to run it, run
```sh
$ cabal run advent-of-haskell -- <DAY> <PART>
```

For example, the following will run day 3 part 2
```sh
$ cabal run advent-of-haskell -- 3 2
```
